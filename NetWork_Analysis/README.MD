# Workflow Overview

The artifact I've created provides a complete R script that:  
- Starts with a **normalized expression matrix** (rows = genes, columns = samples)  
- Performs **WGCNA analysis** to identify co-expression modules  
- Applies **Bayesian Network analysis** to the most interesting module  
- Conducts **enrichment analysis** on the modules  
- Integrates results from both approaches to identify **key regulatory genes**

## Key Components  

### Data Preparation  
- Handles missing values with imputation  
- Prepares expression data in the correct format for WGCNA  

### WGCNA Analysis Flow  
1. Detects and removes outlier samples  
2. Selects the optimal `soft-thresholding power`  
3. Constructs the co-expression network  
4. Identifies modules and their correlation with sample traits  
5. Finds **hub genes** within modules  

### Bayesian Network Analysis  
- Focuses on a subset of genes from the most interesting module  
- Discretizes expression data for Bayesian analysis  
- Learns network structure using `hill-climbing algorithm`  
- Identifies potential **key regulatory genes**  
- Simulates gene perturbations to predict effects  

### Enrichment Analysis  
- Performs **GO term enrichment** (biological processes)  
- Conducts **KEGG pathway analysis**  
- Visualizes enrichment results  

### Integration of Results  
- Identifies genes significant in *both* WGCNA and Bayesian Networks  
- Prioritizes genes for further investigation  
- Provides biological context for key findings

## Practical Considerations  
When applying this to your own data:  
- Replace the `dummy data generation` with your **actual expression matrix**  
- Adjust parameters based on:  
  - Dataset size  
  - Biological context  
- Pay attention to `soft-thresholding power` selection  
- **Computational limits**: Bayesian Networks may be slow for large gene sets

> **Why this workflow?**  
> Combines the strengths of **WGCNA** (co-expression modules) and **Bayesian Networks** (causal inference) for a systems biology approach.
