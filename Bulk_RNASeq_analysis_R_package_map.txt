Roadmap for performing bulk RNA differential expression analysis (DEA) with feature selection and dimension reduction. 
Although few lab do bulk RNAseq data analysis, most of lab prefer to do single cell sequencing analysis

This plan covers the full pipeline from raw count data through statistical analysis, selection of top features, and visualization of sample relationships. 
In future the pipeline can adapt and expand these steps depending on the real experiment design, data format, biomedical hypotheses, and available computing environment.

This part code based on R packages

1. Understand and Prepare Your Data
Experimental Design:
Clarify the conditions/groups and ensure you have enough biological replicates.
Note any batch effects or confounding variables that might need to be modeled.
Data Format:
Ensure you have raw counts (for RNA-Seq) or normalized expression values (for microarray) and accompanying metadata (sample conditions, batch info, etc.).

2. Quality Control (QC) and Preprocessing
QC of Raw Data:
Check raw data quality using tools like FastQC (if starting from raw sequencing reads).
Evaluate mapping rates, gene coverage, and other quality metrics.
Filtering:
Remove low-quality samples (outliers) and filter out lowly expressed genes that are unlikely to be informative.
Normalization:

RNA-Seq: Use normalization methods such as TMM (edgeR), median-of-ratios (DESeq2), or upper quartile normalization.
Microarrays: Apply robust multi-array average (RMA) or similar normalization procedures.

Example in DESeq2 (R):
library(DESeq2)
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                              colData = coldata,
                              design = ~ condition)
# Filter lowly expressed genes:
keep <- rowSums(counts(dds) >= 10) >= 3  # adjust thresholds as needed
dds <- dds[keep, ]
# Run normalization and preprocessing
dds <- DESeq(dds)

3. Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)
Statistical Modeling:
Use specialized packages such as DESeq2, edgeR, or limma (if using voom for RNA-Seq data).
Build a model that represents your experimental design. Include covariates (e.g., batch) if necessary.
Testing for Differential Expression:
Run the DEA pipeline to obtain statistics (log fold changes, p-values, adjusted p-values/FDR).
Set thresholds (e.g., FDR < 0.05 and |log₂FC| > threshold) to define “top” differentially expressed genes.
Example in DESeq2:
res <- results(dds)
# Order by adjusted p-value
resOrdered <- res[order(res$padj), ]
# Get top differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
topDEGs <- head(resOrdered, n = 50)  # e.g., top 50 DEGs
summary(res)

4. Feature Selection
Choosing Top Features:
Use the results from DEA to select a subset of genes that show the most statistically significant and/or highest fold changes.
This set serves as your “feature” list for subsequent analyses.
Alternative Feature Selection Approaches:
Statistical Filters: Use variance filters or other univariate methods.
Machine Learning Methods: Techniques like LASSO regression, Random Forest feature importance, or recursive feature elimination can further refine the gene set if you’re building predictive models.
Biological Relevance:
Consider integrating prior knowledge (e.g., known pathway membership) to focus on genes of biological interest.

5. Dimension Reduction
Purpose:
Reduce the complexity of your dataset to visualize sample relationships and check for underlying patterns (e.g., clusters corresponding to conditions, batch effects, etc.).
Methods:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
A linear method that projects data into components capturing the largest variance.
Quick to compute and useful for detecting outliers and batch effects.
t-SNE or UMAP:
Nonlinear methods that can capture more complex relationships.
Useful for visualization when clusters are non-linearly separable.
Example: PCA in DESeq2 (R):
rld <- rlog(dds, blind = FALSE)  # Regularized log transformation
plotPCA(rld, intgroup = "condition")
Example: t-SNE in R:
library(Rtsne)
# Assuming rldData is your transformed expression matrix
tsne_out <- Rtsne(t(assay(rld)), perplexity = 30)
plot(tsne_out$Y, col = as.factor(coldata$condition), pch = 19,
     main = "t-SNE Plot of RNA-Seq Data")
Interpretation:
Check whether samples from different conditions form distinct clusters.
Use these visualizations to further confirm the separation suggested by DEA.

6. Clustering and Visualization
Heatmaps:
Generate heatmaps of the expression of top DEGs to visualize sample clustering.
Tools: pheatmap, ComplexHeatmap in R.
Example:
library(pheatmap)
# Select normalized counts for top DEGs
topGenes <- rownames(topDEGs)
heatmapData <- assay(rld)[topGenes, ]
pheatmap(heatmapData, scale = "row", annotation_col = coldata)
Hierarchical Clustering:
Perform hierarchical clustering on the expression matrix to see natural groupings.
Validate clusters against experimental conditions.

7. Functional Annotation and Pathway Analysis
Gene Ontology (GO) and Pathway Enrichment:
Use tools like clusterProfiler, DAVID, Enrichr, or g:Profiler to determine if the top DEGs are enriched in specific pathways or biological processes.
Example using clusterProfiler in R:
library(clusterProfiler)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)  # Change according to your organism
geneList <- rownames(topDEGs)
ego <- enrichGO(gene = geneList, 
                OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db, 
                keyType = "SYMBOL", 
                ont = "BP", 
                pAdjustMethod = "BH", 
                qvalueCutoff = 0.05)
dotplot(ego)

8. Validation and Reporting
Cross-validation:
If developing predictive models (e.g., classifying conditions), use cross-validation to assess performance.
Consider external validation datasets if available.
Biological Validation:
Validate key findings using independent experimental methods (e.g., qRT-PCR).
Documentation:
Record every step, parameter choice, and rationale.
Prepare figures (PCA plots, heatmaps, volcano plots) and tables for publication or reports.
